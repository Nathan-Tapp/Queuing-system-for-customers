# Queuing-system-for-customers
# Project 33 posted posted onto github
# Description:
This program simulates a queueing system where customers arrive, 
wait in a queue, and then depart after being served. 
It reads input from a file containing arrival times and service durations for each customer.
The program calculates the departure times for each customer, 
simulates the queueing process, and outputs the processing events for each customer, 
as well as final statistics including the total number of customers processed and the average amount of time spent waiting.
# Input:
The program expects input from a file named "in1.txt" (or any other specified filename).
Each line of the input file should contain two integers separated by a 
space: the arrival time and the service duration for a customer.
# Output:
The program outputs the processing events for each customer, 
including their arrival and departure times. 
After processing all customers, it prints the final statistics, 
including the total number of customers processed and the average 
amount of time spent waiting.
